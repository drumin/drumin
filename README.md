<p align="justify" >I am a graduate student at Northeastern University, pursuing a degree in Cybersecurity. My passion lies in exploring ways to make systems more secure and resilient to cyber attacks. As a cybersecurity enthusiast, I am constantly learning and exploring new techniques to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and technologies in the field.
My expertise lies in both red team and blue team activities. I have gained practical experience in red team activities by participating in Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges on TryHackMe, where I have honed my skills in vulnerability exploitation, and penetration testing. On the blue team side, I have studied subjects such as Information System Forensics and Security Risk Management and Assessment as part of my coursework at Northeastern.
As a cybersecurity professional, I am committed to ensuring the safety and security of digital assets. I am always eager to collaborate with like-minded individuals to develop innovative solutions to the ever-evolving threats in the cyber landscape. </p>
